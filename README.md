Yelda Website Chat Plugin
=====

# Introduction

Yelda Website Chat Plugin is a library that enables your website to load [yelda.ai](https://yelda.ai) webchat in an iframe integrated into your website

![Demo](https://github.com/Yeldaai/chat-plugin/blob/master/screencast-yelda.gif?raw=true "Demo")

# Load the scripts

You can load the scripts from yelda-webchat NPM package or from yelda website

## With Node Packages Manager

**System requirements**
Node.JS 8+

**Install & setup**

- Install with npm

```shell
 npm install yelda-webchat --save
```

- Import yeldaChat js lib and yeldaWebchatInjector.min.css OR load js using script and link tags

Or use import instruction

```javascript
  import yeldaChat from 'yelda-webchat'
  import 'yelda-webchat/dist/css/yeldaWebchatInjector.min.css'
```

Or add the `<script>` in the `<body>`, and the `<link>` in the `<head>` tags

```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/node_modules/yelda/dist/css/yeldaWebchatInjector.min.css"/>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="/node_modules/yelda/dist/js/yeldaWebchatInjector.min.js"></script>
```

## From Yelda website

Each time a new package version is published, we also update static minified version on Yelda.
You can directly load these files with classic script and link tags as explained above

```html
  <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="https://app.yelda.ai/static/css/yeldaWebchatInjector.min.css">
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://app.yelda.ai/static/js/yeldaWebchatInjector.min.js"></script>
```

Using NPM give you the ownership on the Yelda plugin updates. For example you might want to test it in a preprod version to ensure that a CSS change would not affect your stylesheet (each new version is carefully tested, but you might want to check it yourself ðŸ˜‰)
Loading direct link from Yelda ensure to always use the latest version in production without redeploying your website assets (but it might require users to clear their cache)

We don't advise you to download a local version without using the NPM package : you might miss an important update.

# Init the library

Initialize the lib with the Yelda provided elements

- assistantSlug : the webchat short name on Yelda
- assistantId : the webchat id on Yelda
- assistantUrl : `https://app.yelda.ai`
- chatPath : `/chat`
- locale : `fr_FR`
- isAdmin : false (set to true only for intent analysis)
- shouldBeOpened : false
- parentContainerId : `container_id` DOM element id where you want to add the iframe. If the 'container_id' does not exist in the DOM, the iframe will be automatically inserted into the document body
- isStartBtn: false (set to true only if need to show start button)
- canBeClosed: true (used to toggle the visible state of close button, if parentContainerId provided 'canBeClosed' set to false)

```javascript
  yeldaChat.setupChat({
    'assistantSlug': '<assistantSlug>',
    'assistantId': '<assistantId>',
    'assistantUrl': '<assistantUrl>',
    'chatPath': '<chatPath>',
    'locale': '<locale>',
    'isAdmin': true | false, // Used to see the NLP logs
    'isStartBtn': true | false, // Used to show the start button on chat load
    'shouldBeOpened': true | false, // open the chat window by default on loading the page if set to true
    'parentContainerId' : 'chat_frame',
    'canBeClosed': true | false
  })
```

Note : you can replace _setupChat_ function by _init_ if you want to wait for window.onload event.
